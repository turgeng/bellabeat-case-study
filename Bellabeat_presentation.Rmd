## About the Data

- Fitbit Public Dataset (Kaggle, 2016)  
- 30 users: steps, calories, sleep, weight  
- Used for **exploratory** purposes

**ROCCC Review**  
✔️ Relevant  
❌ Not Original  
➖ Limited sample  
❌ Not Current  
⚠️ Not cited

---

## Data Cleaning Summary

- Column name cleanup  
- Date format standardization  
- Removed NAs, duplicates  
- Grouped & merged datasets

Packages used: `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `janitor`, `ggplot2`, `skimr`

---

## Activity Behavior Insights

- Most users moderately active  
- High sedentary time  
- Activity consistency varies  
- More consistent = more steps/calories

---

## Sleep Behavior Insights

- Avg sleep ~6–8 hours  
- Efficiency varies  
- Active users sleep more efficiently (slightly)

---

## Combined Analysis

Merged sleep + activity data:

- No meaningful correlation between physical activity and sleep quality

---

## Marketing Recommendations

- Promote habit building: “daily streaks”  
- Visualize user trends inside the app  
- Educate users on active minutes vs steps  
- Tailor messaging to consistent movers

---

## Limitations

- Data is outdated, non-diverse  
- No gender or contextual data  
- Small sample limits generalization

---

## Future Steps

- Analyze Bellabeat’s internal data  
- Include mindfulness, menstrual, stress data  
- Personalize marketing based on richer segmentation
